This position data of  ABB IRB 120 robot can be used for robot calibration
We provide 120 sample points of ABB IRB 120 robot, which can be used for the verification of manipulator calibration algorithm. The remaining 922 sample points will be published online after accepting our paper. You can read the following papers to understand the principle and methods of manipulator calibration. Here, x, y, z are the coordinates of the position of the robot’s end-effector in the base coordinate system, L is the length of the cable, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6 are the joint angles of the robot.
